Feature: Today's order dishes
  As an order participant
  I want to select dishes for today's order
  In order to prepare the order to reflect team choices

  Background:
    Given user "Mikołaj" exists
    And user "Daniel" exists
    And I am logged in as "Mikołaj"
    And restaurant "Phuong Dong" exists
    And restaurant "Phuong Dong" has been selected for today

  Scenario: User who haven't selected any dish yet can see an empty item with his name at the end of the list
    Given someone has selected "Kurczak słodko-kwaśny" costing "12.30" for "Daniel" for today
    Given nobody has selected any dish for "Mikołaj" for today yet
    When I go to the home page
    Then the last dish should be empty
    And the last dish should be for "Mikołaj"

  # Scenario: User selects an existing dish for himself
  #   Given I am on the home page
  #   When I select dish ""

  # @javascript
  # Scenario: Dish name is suggested
    
  #   When I fill in "restaurant" with "p"
  #   Then I should see "Phuong Dong" within "ul.typeahead"
